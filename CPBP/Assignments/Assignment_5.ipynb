    "Answer:\n",
    "What are different access modes in which you can open the file.\n",
    "In Python, you can open files in various modes depending on what you want to do with the file. Here are the different access modes you can use with the open() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read Mode\n",
    "'r': Read mode. Opens a file for reading only (default mode). The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, it raises an FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Mode\n",
    "'w': Write mode. Opens a file for writing only. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length (i.e., deletes its contents). If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append Mode\n",
    "'a': Append mode. Opens a file for writing. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and Write Mode\n",
    "'r+': Read and write mode. Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w+': Write and read mode. Opens a file for both writing and reading. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a+': Append and read mode. Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Mode\n",
    "'b': Binary mode. You can combine this with other modes to specify that a file should be treated as binary. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "'rb': Read-only binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'wb': Write-only binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'ab': Append-only binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'r+b': Read and write binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w+b': Write and read binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a+b': Append and read binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Mode\n",
    "'t': Text mode (default mode). You can combine this with other modes to specify that a file should be treated as text. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "'rt': Read-only text mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'wt': Write-only text mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'at': Append-only text mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, text mode is the default when opening a file, so you don't need to specify 't' explicitly. However, binary mode can be important when dealing with non-text files like images or executables."
